# Introduction
This repository serves as a "Java 101" guide, demonstrating essential Java programming constructs. Each file focuses on a specific fundamental topic, making it easy to learn and grasp the basics.

# Files in this Repository
# HelloWorld.java
This classic program is the traditional first step in learning any new programming language. It simply prints "Hello, World!" to the console. It demonstrates the basic structure of a Java class and the main method, which is the entry point for Java applications.

# VariableExample.java
This file illustrates the concept of variables in Java. It covers:

What a variable is: A combination of a data type, an identifier, and an optional initializer (value).
Primitive Data Types:
- byte
- short
- int
- long
- char
- float
- double
- boolean

Non-Primitive Data Types:
- String
- Arrays
- Classes
- Interfaces
  
Variable Declaration and Initialization: Examples of declaring and assigning values to String, int, double, boolean, char, long, and float variables.
Printing Variables: How to output variable values to the console using System.out.println().

# StudentInfo.java
Building on the VariableExample, this file demonstrates the practical application of different data types to store various pieces of information about a student. It showcases how to:

- Store personal information (first name, last name, student ID).
- Manage academic details (GPA, credits completed, major).
- Record physical attributes (height, weight).
- Handle contact information (email, phone number).
- Utilize boolean flags for status (full-time, scholarship, international).
- Include location information (county, constituency).
- Store additional details like section, national ID, and tuition owed.
- Display all the collected student information in a readable format.

# JavaOperators.java
This file provides a comprehensive overview of various operators in Java, including:

Arithmetic Operators:
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
- Modulus (%)

Assignment Operators:
- Simple assignment (=)
- Addition assignment (+=)
- Subtraction assignment (-=)
- Multiplication assignment (*=)
- Division assignment (/=)
- Modulus assignment (%=)

Relational Operators:
- Equal to (==)
- Not equal to (!=)
- Greater than (>)
- Greater than or equal to (>=)
- Increment / Decrement Operators:
- Prefix increment (++value)
- Postfix increment (value++)

How to Run the Examples
To run these Java examples, you'll need the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/SentinelleTech/java-101.git

cd java-101

Compile a Java file (e.g., HelloWorld.java):
javac HelloWorld.java

Run the compiled Java class:
java HelloWorld

Replace HelloWorld with the name of the class you wish to run (e.g., VariableExample, StudentInfo, JavaOperators).
